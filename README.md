*DESCRIPTION:* This code implements a machine learning-based spam email classifier using Python. The goal is to automatically detect whether an incoming email is spam (unwanted messages) or ham (legitimate emails). Below is a detailed breakdown of how the system works, its key components, and how you can use it.

1. Overview of the Spam Detection System
Spam detection is a classic example of text classification in machine learning. The system learns from a dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) and then predicts the category of new, unseen emails.

Key Features of This Implementation:
  - Uses Naive Bayes, a simple yet effective algorithm for text classification
  - Preprocesses text data to improve accuracy
  - Evaluates performance using standard metrics
  - Can be extended for real-world use

2. Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code:
A. Loading and Preparing the Data
The program starts by loading the dataset (spam.csv), which contains:
  - Email text (the content of the message)
  - Labels (spam or ham)
B. Cleaning and Preprocessing the Text
Raw text data is messy, so we clean it before feeding it into the model:
  - Remove punctuation (e.g., "free!" → "free")
  - Convert to lowercase ("FREE" → "free")
  - Remove stopwords (common words like "the," "and")
  - Stemming (reducing words to their root form, e.g., "running" → "run")
C. Converting Text to Numerical Features (TF-IDF)
Machine learning models require numerical input, so we convert words into TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors, which measure word importance.
D. Training the Machine Learning Model
We use Naive Bayes, a probabilistic algorithm that works well for text classification.
E. Evaluating Model Performance
We check how well the model performs on unseen data using accuracy score.
F. Making Predictions on New Emails
Finally, we can use the trained model to classify new emails.
